# Local-Global Fusion Network for Video Super-Resolution

This repository is about Local-Global Fusioin Network for Video Super-Resolution (LGFN). The source code will be released as soon as the paper is accepted.

## Introduction

Our proposed Local-Global Fusion Network for Video Super-Resolution (LGFN) devotes to effectively addressing the problem of restoring low-resolution (LR) videos to high-resolution (HR) ones. Features are extracted from the input frames through a feature extraction module. Then, we align the neighboring frames with the reference frame through stacked deformable convolutions (DCs) with decreased multi-dilation convolution units (DMDCUs) to predict more accurate parameters. After that, features are fused by local fusion module and global fusion module respectively. The outputs are integrated together and sent into the reconstruction module to restore high resolution video frames.
